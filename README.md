# ML Project – Supervised Model Training & Evaluation

## Overview
End-to-end supervised machine learning project focused on building and evaluating predictive models using real-world datasets.  
Dataset partially sourced via collaboration; full preprocessing pipeline, model development, training, evaluation, and result analysis were completed independently.

## Problem Statement
Real-world datasets often contain noise, imbalance, and limited feature structure that reduce predictive performance. This project explores feature preprocessing and model selection techniques to improve classification accuracy.

## My Role
- Dataset cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Model selection & architecture design
- Training pipeline implementation
- Performance evaluation & tuning

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ML Pipeline
1. Dataset ingestion
2. Data cleaning (missing values, normalization)
3. Feature extraction & scaling
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
5. Hyperparameter tuning
6. Evaluation & error analysis

## Results
- Baseline Accuracy: XX%
- Tuned Model Accuracy: XX%
- Precision / Recall / F1 improvements after tuning

## Key Learnings
- Impact of feature scaling on convergence speed
- Overfitting reduction via cross-validation
- Tradeoffs between simpler classifiers and ensemble methods

## Demo
Supporting notebooks and evaluation plots provided in this repo.
